Please see [Lokka.dev](https://lokka.dev) for how to use Lokka with your favorite AI model and chat client.

Lokka lets you use Claude Desktop, or any MCP Client, to use natural language to accomplish things in your Microsoft 365 tenant through the Microsoft Graph API.

e.g.:

- `Create a new security group called 'Sales and HR' with a dynamic rule based on the department attribute.` 
- `Find all the conditional access policies that haven't excluded the emergency access account`
- `Show me all the Intune device configuration policies assigned to the 'Call center' group`
